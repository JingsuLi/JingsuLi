# Jingsu Li

CS/Math @ UIUC  
Building small systems around agents. Mostly experimenting with autonomy, orchestration, and behavior-level memory.

---

## 🔍 Current focus

- lightweight agent runners & local routing logic  
- task-level autonomy and retry strategy  
- observable agent traces (logs, error paths, feedback)  
- agent-to-agent communication without central control

Not aiming for end-user tools. Mostly testing frameworks, workflows, and limits.
